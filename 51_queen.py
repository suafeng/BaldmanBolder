# n queen
# The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard
# such that no two queens attack each other.

# for a queen placed at (x, y), for position (p, q), if p+q=x+y or p-q=x-y, this
# position can be attacked by the queen. Based on this, we place the queen line
# by line. we have array queens, queens[i], i is the ith line, queens[i] is the
# queen's postion in this line. Do backtracing using recursive function. Add
# queens to the result if we have a qualified queen array. xy_sum and xy_dif
# store each queen's p+q and p-q data.

    # result, queens, xy_sum, xy_dif are arrays
