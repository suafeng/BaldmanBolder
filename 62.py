# Unique Paths

# A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
#
# The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
#
# How many possible unique paths are there?

# interesting dp
# p(x, y) = p(x-1, y) + p(x, y-1)
